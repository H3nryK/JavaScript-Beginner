Example
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

What is this?
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

Note
this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.

this in a Method
When used in an object method, this refers to the object.

In the example on top of this page, this refers to the person object.

Because the fullName method is a method of the person object.

fullName : function() {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}

this Alone
When used alone, this refers to the global object.

Because this is running in the global scope.

In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:

Example
let x = this;

this in a Function (Default)
In a function, the global object is the default binding for this.

In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:

Example
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}

this in a Function (Strict)
JavaScript strict mode does not allow default binding.

So, when used in a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.

Example
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}

this in Event Handlers
In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:

Example
<button onclick="this.style.display='none'">
  Click to Remove Me!
</button>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>The JavaScript <i>this</i> Keyword</h1>
<p>In this example, <b>this</b> refers to the <b>person</b> object.</p>
<p>Because <b>fullName</b> is a method of the person object.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>

</body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>The JavaScript <i>this</i> Keyword</h1>

<p>In this example, <b>this</b> refers to the window object:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
"use strict";
let x = this;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>The JavaScript <i>this</i> Keyword</h1>

<button onclick="this.style.display='none'">Click to Remove Me!</button>

</body>
